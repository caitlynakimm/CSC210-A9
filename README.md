## Assignment Reflection

Please reflect on your experience with this assignment. What was most challenging? What was most interesting?  What did you learn that you might use again?
- The most challenging aspect part of this assignment was converting a binary tree to a doubly linked list for me. It was difficult to figure out what type of data type the helper function should return and converting from a binary tree data type, to an array, and to a doubly linked list. I think the most interesting part of this assignment was testing different trees, modifying them with different operations, and seeing if the new trees matched my expectations. I think I might use the binary tree operations, I learned in the future if I want to use binary trees for a project.
